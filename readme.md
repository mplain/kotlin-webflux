Hi! This is my demo project of a Kotlin + Spring WebFlux microservice

It is written in a functional programming style using Project Reactor's Mono and Flux classes (no Kotlin coroutines)

It demonstrates the use of the following technologies:

- Kafka
- MongoDB
- HTML Rendering
- Server-Sent Events
- Video Streaming
